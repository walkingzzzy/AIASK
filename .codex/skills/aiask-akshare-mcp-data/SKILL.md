# AIASK AKShare MCP Data

## Workflow

1. Read [references/mcp-runtime-and-tool-surface.md](references/mcp-runtime-and-tool-surface.md) before changing server startup, profiles, transports, tool registration, resources, prompts, or runtime skill tools.
2. Read [references/data-sync-and-storage.md](references/data-sync-and-storage.md) before changing data source routing, TDX/TQCenter behavior, SQLite schemas/adapters, sync scripts, readiness checks, or freshness gates.
3. Keep data acquisition/storage ownership in AKShare MCP or Quant Core; do not push it into Agent or Desktop.
4. Preserve explicit data source metadata, stale/degraded/fallback signals, and local-only behavior.
5. Avoid mutation-heavy sync in tests unless explicitly scoped.

## Hard Rules

- Respect `TDX_LOCAL_ONLY`, `AKSHARE_MCP_SQLITE_PATH`, and `AIASK_SQLITE_PATH`.
- Do not make Tushare or online providers unconditional startup dependencies.
- HTTP MCP transports must keep loopback/auth/origin safeguards.
- Runtime AKShare skill tools are not the same as Codex skills in `.codex/skills`.
- Do not silently hide stale, empty, fallback, or optional-source failures.
