# AIASK Incubation Factory

## Workflow

1. Read [references/runner-phases.md](references/runner-phases.md) before changing runners, daemon/status/dry-run behavior, phase error handling, or factory status.
2. Read [references/pipeline-and-feedback.md](references/pipeline-and-feedback.md) before changing stage transitions, observation intake, forward verification, hit-rate matrix, promotion gates, feedback writes, or Desktop/Agent status.
3. Preserve dry-run behavior and explicit write paths.
4. Keep diagnostic/paper/live boundaries visible; paper or diagnostic observation is not live trading readiness.
5. Add tests for stage, gate, hit-rate, or feedback behavior changes.
