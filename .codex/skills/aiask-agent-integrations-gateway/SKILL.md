description: Use this skill when working on AIASK Agent integrations including MCP aggregation, ACP-provided MCP servers, native plugins, runtime skills/skill packs, unified connectors, Gateway daemon/platforms/messages/directory, webhooks, Home Assistant, Feishu/Lark, Discord, and cross-platform delivery through Agent HTTP or `agent_*` tools.

# AIASK Agent Integrations Gateway

## Workflow

1. Read [references/mcp-plugins-skills-connectors.md](references/mcp-plugins-skills-connectors.md) before changing MCP aggregation, connector discovery, plugin lifecycle, runtime skills, or skill packs.
2. Read [references/gateway-platforms-webhooks.md](references/gateway-platforms-webhooks.md) before changing gateway daemon behavior, platform APIs, message delivery, retries, directories, webhooks, Home Assistant, Feishu/Lark, or Discord.
3. Keep integration capabilities behind Agent HTTP APIs or `agent_*` facades.
4. Preserve control-token gates for management and mutation.
5. Treat external delivery and platform writes as side-effectful; use ActionIntent or explicit gated routes where existing behavior requires it.
