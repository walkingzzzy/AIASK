# AIASK AKShare Research Analytics

## Workflow

1. Read [references/financial-tool-surface.md](references/financial-tool-surface.md) before changing MCP financial tools, stock analysis workflows, backtest/portfolio/valuation/decision tools, alerts, or argument contracts.
2. Read [references/research-decision-vector-sentiment.md](references/research-decision-vector-sentiment.md) before changing LLM strategy generation, factor research, vector/search, sentiment/news, stock deep analysis, or research workflow contracts.
3. Preserve structured tool outputs and explicit degraded/fallback states.
4. Keep stateful strategy or manager actions behind manager protocol and Agent facades.
5. Add focused tests for statistical, data-quality, LLM parsing, or vector contract changes.
