# AIASK AKShare Manager Plane

## Workflow

1. Read [references/manager-catalog.md](references/manager-catalog.md) before changing manager actions, handler files, or manager contracts.
2. Read [references/side-effects-and-safety.md](references/side-effects-and-safety.md) before changing side-effect levels, confirmation requirements, trade-risk behavior, or Agent wrappers.
3. Keep manager internals hidden behind manager protocol, MCP tools, and Agent `agent_*` facades.
4. Add negative tests for any new stateful or trade-risk action.

## Hard Rules

- Do not expose raw manager names as model-visible Agent tools.
- Keep read-only, stateful, and trade-risk actions distinguishable in metadata.
- Live trading/order operations require explicit broker-token guardrails.
- Manager failures should return structured envelopes, not silent success.
